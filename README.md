## NLW E-sports Project

## About
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, I followed instructions from the [RocketSeat team](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) to develop an application where players can find partners to play together.

## Technologies:
- React;
- React Native;
- Typescript
- Tailwind;
- Node.JS;
- Prisma;
- Express

## How to run the project:
- git clone the repository;
- Navigate to each folder and install the dependencies with `npm install`;
- Run the server with `npm run dev` and the web application with the same command;
- Run the mobile with `expo start`;
- You will need the server running for both applications to work;
